# Unpack
This Chrome extension helps you to decode a Base64 + MessagePack text. It was created by me in order to streamline the end-to-end testing
process of RabbitMQ messages, which were encoded in MessagePack.

# Installation
Currently this extension is not published on the Chrome Web Store, thus you will need to manually install it via the following steps:
1. Clone the repository on your machine
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` on Google Chrome
3. Enable `Developer mode`
4. Load the extension by clicking on the button `Load unpacked` and searching for the previously cloned folder
